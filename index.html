            <h2>Score calculution</h2>
            <p>
                The distance between the country you guessed and the actual country is calculated with a modified version of
                the Haversine forumla that gives a maximum value of 1. That value is fed into a steep exponentially
                decreasing function (<i>y = e<sup>-8x</sup></i>) to give a score between 0 and 1. Obviously, this system
                will be a lot more lenient for, say, guessing countries in Europe as opposed to guessing countries in Africa,
                but I had to make a compromise.
            </p>
            <h2><span class="total-countries"></span> countries? There are only X in the world!</h2>
            <p>
                A - Eat shit. B - The UN recognizes 193 countries as, well, countries, but the only internationally recognized system
                that uniformly assigns an <i>identifier</i> to each "country" is the ISO 3166 standard, which lists 249 designated
                territories. This, however, includes dependant territories, and the quiz is hard enough without them, so I
                pruned a lot of em out. You can view the entire list, and more details
