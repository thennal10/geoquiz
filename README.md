A simple quiz for the geography nerds among us. Made because coronavirus sucks and I'm very bored. Open up an issue if anything breaks.

## How does this work?

### The code
This thing is an absolute bodge, if you haven't guessed already, so I haven't really documented much. The country data is sourced
from [restcountries.eu](https://restcountries.eu/),and Mapbox is for the actual map. Uses a custom tileset, with data from
[Natural Earth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/). Something like LeafletJS or OpenStreetMap might've been better for this, 
but hey I already made most of it so Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯.

### Score calculution

The distance between the country you guessed and the actual country is calculated with a modified version of
the Haversine forumla that gives a maximum value of 1. That value is fed into a steep exponentially
decreasing function (y = e<sup>-8x</sup>) to give a score between 0 and 1. Obviously, this system
will be a lot more lenient for, say, guessing countries in Europe as opposed to guessing countries in Africa,
but I had to make a compromise.

### 201 countries? There are only X countries in the world!

A - Eat shit. B - The UN recognizes 193 countries as, well, countries, but the only internationally recognized
system that uniformly assigns an *identifier* to each "country" is the ISO 3166 standard, which lists 249 designated
territories. This, however, includes dependant territories, and the quiz is hard enough without them, so I
pruned a lot of em out. However, I did leave in some well known ones, like Greenland. Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macau
are also included, because fuck China. Disputed territories are a spiky subject, but I went with how Natural Earth
drew the borders. In particular, Western Sahara isn't included, but Kosovo and Palestine are. Antartica is included too because yes.
Here's the entire list of pruned countries in table form:
